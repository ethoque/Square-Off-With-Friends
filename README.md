## Square Off With Friends using React and Node.js / Express ##

* Play with friends by joining the same room (any letters and or numbers are valid!)
* Once two players join you're able to play Dots and Boxes and upon winning the board will reset after displaying final scores
* If a room has 2 players any subsequent players that join will be able to spectate the ongoing game, and if one of the two players leave the two oldest players in the room will instead play against each other.
